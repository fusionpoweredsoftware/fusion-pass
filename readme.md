# Fusion Pass - A Secure Password Generator

## Overview
This project includes two Python scripts that work together to generate a secure, deterministic password based on user input. The first script generates an encryption key and stores it, while the second script uses this key along with a criteria file to generate a password.

### Components
- `passkeygen.py`: Generates and saves a cryptographic key.
- `passgen.py`: Generates a password using the cryptographic key and a set of allowed characters defined in a criteria file.

## Requirements
- Python 3.6 or higher
- `cryptography` module

## Setup

### Installing Python
Ensure that Python 3.6 or newer is installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Installing Dependencies
This project requires the `cryptography` library. Install it using pip:
```bash
pip install cryptography
```

### Files
- **pass.key**: Generated by `passkeygen.py`, this file stores the encryption key.
- **pass.crit**: You should manually create this file to specify the character set that the generated passwords can use. For example:
  ```
  ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789!@#$%^&*()_+-=[]{}|;:',.<>/?~
  ```

## Usage

### Generating the Key
Run `passkeygen.py` to generate a new cryptographic key:
```bash
python passkeygen.py
```
This will create `pass.key`, which will be used by the password generator.

### Generating a Password
1. Ensure `pass.crit` is in the same directory with the desired characters.
2. Run `passgen.py` and follow the on-screen prompt to enter your base password:
```bash
python passgen.py
```
The script will display the generated password that conforms to the criteria specified in `pass.crit`.

## Security Notes
- Keep `pass.key` secure to prevent unauthorized access to your password generation system.
- Regularly update your criteria in `pass.crit` to adapt to evolving security standards.
